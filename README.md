Dungeon of Daggorath Audio Recording of ZSAVE (level 1 to level 5)

These files are high-quality WAV recordings of the audio produced during ZSAVE (game-state saving) during my playthrough of DoD in January 2022.

You can use a smartphone or tablet to play this audio back, or a whole desktop PC, or of course an original cassette recorder.   Just use the ZLOAD command from within
DoD, and play the WAV file that you want to load.  However, you will need the Tandy Cassette cable in order to input that audio into the CoCo hardware.

I have notes on this setup posted here:

For reference, my full DoD playthrough is located here:

I've used these same WAV files to re-load the game-state on both a physical CoCo1 and CoCo3.

Cheers!
